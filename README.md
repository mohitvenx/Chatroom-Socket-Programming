# Client-Server Chat Room

This project is a chat room with one server and multiple clients. The server provides a
chat room for clients to join. After joining the chat, the clients can send messages to the chat
room where all chat messages are logged and displayed.

### Getting Started

1. Open a terminal and create a chat room by running Server.py
``` bash
cd <root>
python Server.py
```

2. In another terminal, create and add a client to the chat room by running Client.py
``` bash
python Client.py [name] # Don't forget to declare the client's name
```

3. You can add more clients in the room by running more Client.py in more terminals.

4. Let's have a chat!

### Demo

1. First, open 3 terminals and run the code.

2. Send messages from Person_A and Person_B to the chat room. Everyone in the room received messages immediately.
